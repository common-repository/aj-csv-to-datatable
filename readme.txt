Wordpress Plugin to import data from a CSV file and display it in a DataTable.


== Description ==

Wordpress Plugin to present a CSV file in a DataTable. This will import data from a CSV file and display in a DataTable.


== How To Use ==

Insert following code snippet into any page or post using this shortcode, make sure you use an unique id :

`[aj-csv2dt src=http://e-innoving.com/samples/SacramentocrimeJanuary2006.csv id=datatable_id]`

You can now disable DataTable search, pagination, sorting and displaying of bInfo with the recent 1.1 release. The purpose of this is to render a static looking HTML Table out of a CSV file. 

`[aj-csv2dt src=http://e-innoving.com/samples/SacramentocrimeJanuary2006.csv id=datatable_id disable_search=true disable_paging=true disable_binfo=true disable_sorting=true]`


Save it, just refresh the page and see. Less hassle, all your csv data is inside the DataTable.


== Installation ==

1. Install and activate the plugin via `WP-Admin > Plugins`.
2. Add shortcode to a post or page: `[aj-csv2dt src=http://samplecsvs.s3.amazonaws.com/SacramentocrimeJanuary2006.csv id=datatable_id]`.

== Credits ==

This plugin utilizes some excellent open source scripts, functions and images whose creators deserve to be recognized.

1. Shaun Scovil, for inspiring me through his CSV to Sortable Plugin.
2. V.Krishn wrote a handy [PHP function] that enables users of PHP < 5.3 to utilize the `str_getcsv()` function that powers this plugin.

== Common Errors ==

1. If the datatable misbehaves, this is probably due to an incorrect csv format. In that case, open csv file in excel
and re-save it as a new csv. Most likely this will resolve your issue.
